# Case Study 2 - Cleaning Bank Data Using Pandas

## Problem Statement:

Subset, clean, and reformat the `bank_marketing.csv` dataset to create and store three new files based on the requirements detailed in the notebook.

- Split and tidy `bank_marketing.csv`, storing as three DataFrames called `client`, `campaign`, and `economics`, each containing the columns outlined in the notebook and formatted to the data types listed.
- Save the three DataFrames to csv files, without an index, as `client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv` respectively.
